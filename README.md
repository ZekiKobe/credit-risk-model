### Credit Scoring Business Understanding.

### Task 1: Credit Scoring Business Understanding
Here's what you should include in your README.md:

How Basel II influences model requirements
Basel II emphasizes three pillars: minimum capital requirements, supervisory review, and market discipline. This means:

Our model must be interpretable to satisfy regulatory scrutiny

Documentation must clearly show how risk is measured and quantified

We need to demonstrate the model's predictive power and stability over time

The model must align with the bank's risk appetite and capital allocation strategies

Proxy variable necessity and risks
Since we lack direct default data:

A proxy based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) patterns can estimate risk

Potential proxy: Customers with frequent late payments or fraud flags as "high risk"

Business risks include:

Misclassification leading to lost revenue (false positives) or defaults (false negatives)

Proxy may not perfectly correlate with actual repayment behavior

Potential bias in the proxy affecting certain customer segments

Model complexity trade-offs
Simple models (Logistic Regression with WoE):

Pros: Easily interpretable, regulatory-friendly, simpler to validate

Cons: May miss complex patterns, lower predictive power

Complex models (Gradient Boosting):

Pros: Higher accuracy, captures non-linear relationships

Cons: Black-box nature raises regulatory concerns, harder to explain decisions

In regulated finance, we often start simple and only add complexity if it provides material improvement that justifies the compliance overhead.

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objectives
Understand dataset structure and quality

Identify patterns in transaction behavior

Detect anomalies and outliers

Assess relationships between features

Formulate hypotheses for feature engineering

Key Findings
1. Dataset Overview
Shape: [X] rows × [Y] columns

Data Types:

Numerical: Amount, Value, FraudResult

Categorical: ProductCategory, ChannelId, CountryCode

Temporal: TransactionStartTime

Unique Customers: [Z] distinct AccountIds

2. Data Quality
Missing Values:

[Column_A]: [N]% missing (Requires imputation)

[Column_B]: [M]% missing (May be dropped)

Inconsistencies:

[Issue] detected in [Column] (e.g., negative values in Amount for credits)

3. Transaction Analysis
Amount Distribution:

Right-skewed with mean = $[X], median = $[Y]

Outliers: [K] transactions ([P]%) exceed ±1.5×IQR

Fraud rate in outliers: [Q]% (vs. overall [R]%)

Fraud Prevalence:

Overall fraud rate: [F]%

Higher fraud likelihood for:

Transactions > $[Threshold]

[Specific_Product_Category]

4. RFM Analysis (Risk Proxy)
Metric	Pattern	Risk Implication
Recency	[X]% customers inactive >30d	Higher risk for new/lapsed users
Frequency	Top [Y]% account for [Z]% of transactions	High frequency → Lower risk
Monetary	[A]% of revenue from [B]% users	High spenders → Higher risk
5. Correlation Insights
Strong Positive Correlations:

Amount ↔ Value (r = [X])

[Feature_A] ↔ FraudResult (r = [Y])

Negative Relationships:

Recency ↔ Frequency (r = -[Z])

Actionable Insights
Risk Proxy Definition:

High-risk users exhibit:

FraudResult = 1

Recency > [X] days

Transaction amounts > $[Y]

Feature Engineering Priorities:

Create:

Temporal Features: Day/hour of transaction

Behavioral Metrics: Rolling transaction frequency

Risk Flags: Outlier transactions

Data Cleaning Required:

Impute missing [Column] with [Method]

Cap extreme values in Amount at [P]th percentile

Modeling Considerations:

Class Imbalance: Fraud cases are rare ([F]%) → Require stratification/SMOTE

Non-Linear Relationships: RFM metrics show exponential distributions → Consider log transforms
